## The Truth About Casino Bonuses

Most crypto casino bonuses are designed to look better than they really are. You'll often see big promises like "100% up to $1000," but when you check the terms, you find the infamous wagering requirement lurking in the fine print.

A 40x wagering requirement on a $100 bonus means you need to wager $4,000 before seeing any bonus winnings. Given the house edge, most players will lose the bonus long before reaching that threshold.

## How to Spot a Bonus That's Actually Worth It

### 1. Low Wagering Requirements
Requirements under 20x are decent. Anything over 30x usually means you're stuck grinding with little chance of profit.

### 2. Crypto-Specific Offers
The offer should apply to crypto deposits, not just fiat users. Some platforms advertise bonuses that exclude cryptocurrency.

### 3. Visible Terms
Terms and conditions should be visible before you claim the bonus. Hidden restrictions are a major red flag.

### 4. No Withdrawal Caps
Avoid sites that cap your max withdrawal from bonus wins. Some limit you to 5x the bonus regardless of how much you win.

### 5. Ongoing Rewards
Cashback and loyalty rewards typically provide better long-term value than one-time deposit gifts.
