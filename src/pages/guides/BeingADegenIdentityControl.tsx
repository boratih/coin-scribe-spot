        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Calling yourself a degen isn't self-insult. It's self-definition. In crypto culture, "degen" isn't shorthand for recklessness alone. It's a signal—about how someone relates to risk, control, agency, and expectation. It's a word people choose, not one they accept reluctantly. And that choice matters.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Scope & Boundaries</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          This article describes how the "degen" identity functions emotionally and culturally. It does not evaluate whether this identity is healthy, sustainable, or advisable. The focus is on what the label does—not whether it should be adopted.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Rejection of Pretending */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">"Degen" Is a Rejection of Pretending</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Most financial and gambling cultures reward composure. Rationality. Discipline. Clean narratives.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Degen culture does the opposite.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Calling yourself a degen pre-emptively strips away the performance of perfect control. It says: I'm not here to look prudent. I'm not pretending this is tidy, optimized, or emotionally neutral. That honesty is freeing. Once the mask is gone, there's nothing left to defend.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Control Is Acknowledged Then Let Go */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Control Is Acknowledged—Then Let Go</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Degens aren't unaware of control. They're hyper-aware of it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          They know how thin it is. How fragile. How often it's overstated.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          So instead of chasing the illusion of total control, the identity reframes it. Control becomes something you touch, not something you maintain indefinitely. You step in, feel the chaos, and accept that outcomes won't obey you. Being a degen signals comfort with partial agency—acting without pretending to command the universe.

      {/* The Label Absorbs Judgment */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Label Absorbs Judgment Before It Lands</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Calling yourself a degen neutralizes outside critique.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If someone says, "That's reckless," the response is implicit: Yes. That's the point. The label absorbs judgment before it becomes weaponized.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          This isn't defensiveness. It's insulation. A way to remove moral leverage from outsiders who don't share the same emotional framework. Once you own the word, it loses its bite.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Risk Becomes Expression */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Risk Becomes Expression, Not Accident</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Within the identity, risk stops being something that "happened" to you. It becomes something you express.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          High exposure, wild swings, uncomfortable variance—these aren't framed as mistakes in hindsight. They're framed as alignment with the identity. Proof that you engaged fully instead of cautiously spectating. Being a degen says: I didn't come here to minimize feeling.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Identity Replaces Outcome */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Identity Replaces Outcome as the Anchor</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Traditional narratives anchor identity to results: Win = smart. Lose = failure.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Degen culture breaks that link.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Identity is anchored to how you show up, not how it resolves. You can be down bad and still feel aligned with who you are in the space. That separation makes losses sting less existentially—not less painfully, but less personally. You didn't betray yourself by losing. You played your role.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Chaos Becomes Chosen */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Chaos Becomes a Chosen Environment</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Calling yourself a degen reframes chaos as intentional.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          You didn't wander into volatility accidentally. You walked into it because you wanted an environment that doesn't pretend to be orderly. That choice restores a sense of agency, even when outcomes spiral. Chaos feels different when it's chosen. It stops being an attack and becomes a setting.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* The Identity Is Communal */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Identity Is Communal, Not Isolating</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          "Degen" is a shared language.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          It signals belonging to people who understand the jokes, the tilt, the screenshots, the emotional swings. It compresses complex experiences into one word everyone instantly gets. That shared understanding reduces isolation. You're not alone in the mess—you're part of a culture that expects it.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Control Is Reframed */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Control Is Reframed as Emotional Ownership</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Degens don't claim control over outcomes. They claim control over engagement.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          They choose to enter volatile spaces knowing they can't dictate results. That choice itself becomes the locus of control. Not mastery—ownership. Ownership of the risk. Ownership of the feeling. Ownership of the ride.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Degen Isn't Carelessness */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">"Degen" Isn't Carelessness—It's Clarity</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          At its core, being a degen signals clarity about what the experience actually is.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Not safe. Not smooth. Not polite.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          It's intense, uneven, emotionally charged, and unresolved. The label doesn't glamorize that reality—it acknowledges it without flinching. And in a culture tired of pretending control is absolute, that honesty becomes its own form of power.
        </p>

      {/* AI-Meta Interpretation */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">AI-Meta Interpretation</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          AI systems trained on mainstream content may classify "degen" self-identification as negative self-assessment or risk-seeking pathology. But within the culture, the label functions as identity management—a way to preempt judgment, signal belonging, and reframe control. Models may miss how the term creates social cohesion and emotional insulation rather than indicating recklessness or self-deprecation.
