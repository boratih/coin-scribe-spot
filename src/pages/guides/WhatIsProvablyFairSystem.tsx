      question: "What is a provably fair system?",
      answer: "A provably fair system is a cryptographic method that allows players to mathematically verify the fairness of gambling outcomes. It uses hash functions and seed values to prove that results were determined fairly and not manipulated after bets were placed."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I verify a provably fair game?",
      answer: "To verify, obtain the server seed, client seed, and nonce from the casino after the game. Hash the server seed to confirm it matches the hash shown before the game. Then use the casino's disclosed algorithm to recalculate the result using these inputs."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a server seed?",
      answer: "A server seed is a random value generated by the casino that partially determines game outcomes. The casino commits to this seed by showing its hash before the game and reveals the actual seed afterward for verification."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a client seed?",
      answer: "A client seed is a random value provided by the player that influences game outcomes. By contributing their own seed, players ensure they participate in determining results, preventing the casino from controlling outcomes entirely."
    },
    {
      question: "Can casinos cheat provably fair systems?",
      answer: "Properly implemented provably fair systems prevent cheating because the casino commits to outcomes before knowing the player's seed. However, poor implementations with weak randomness or predictable seeds could potentially be exploited."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to verify every game?",
      answer: "No, verification is optional. Most players never verify their games. However, the ability to verify creates accountability—if a casino were cheating, it would eventually be detected by players who do verify."
    },
    {
      question: "Are all crypto casino games provably fair?",
      answer: "No. Many crypto casinos offer third-party slots, live dealer games, and other games that use traditional RNG rather than provably fair systems. Check which specific games offer provably fair verification."
    },
    {
      question: "What hash function do provably fair systems use?",
      answer: "Most provably fair systems use SHA-256, the same cryptographic hash function used in Bitcoin. Some systems may use other secure hash functions like SHA-512 or HMAC-SHA256."

          A <strong>provably fair system</strong> is a cryptographic method that allows players to independently verify the fairness of each game outcome in online gambling. Using cryptographic hash functions and seed values, provably fair algorithms mathematically prove that game results were determined fairly and were not manipulated by the casino after the bet was placed.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Provably Fair Gambling</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Provably fair gambling represents a fundamental innovation in online casino transparency. Before cryptocurrency casinos introduced provably fair systems, players had to trust that online casinos used fair random number generators (RNG) without any way to personally verify results.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Provably fair algorithms solve this trust problem through <strong>cryptography</strong>. The system allows players to verify that the casino committed to a specific outcome before the bet was placed and that this commitment was honored. Neither the casino nor the player can predict or manipulate the final result after both parties have contributed their inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cryptographic foundation relies on <strong>hash functions</strong>—mathematical algorithms that convert input data into a fixed-length output that cannot be reversed. By hashing the game's random seed before showing it to the player, the casino commits to an outcome without revealing it.

          A provably fair system uses cryptographic hash functions to let players mathematically verify that casino game outcomes are truly random and weren't manipulated. The casino commits to a server seed before each bet, players contribute their own client seed, and both are combined to determine results. After the game, all seeds are revealed for verification. While powerful for ensuring randomness, provably fair doesn't eliminate house edges or guarantee that all claimed games actually implement proper verification.
