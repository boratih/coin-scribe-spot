        <p>
          Provably fair (PF) crypto casino games allow players to verify game outcomes independently. By using cryptographic hashes, server and client seeds, and nonces, PF ensures fairness and transparency that traditional RNG games cannot match.

          Provably fair verification is the process by which players independently confirm crypto casino game outcomes using cryptographic hashes, server seeds, client seeds, and nonces to mathematically prove results were not manipulated.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Verification Works</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
          PF is a system where both the casino and player contribute to randomness, enabling independent verification of outcomes.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
          <li><strong>Server Seed:</strong> Generated by the casino, hashed, and published before betting.</li>
          <li><strong>Client Seed:</strong> Player input for added randomness.</li>
          <li><strong>Nonce:</strong> Increments per bet to ensure unique results.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Step-by-Step Verification</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
          <li><strong>Check Server Seed Hash:</strong> Provided before gameplay.</li>
          <li><strong>Input Client Seed:</strong> Optional, adds player-controlled randomness.</li>
          <li><strong>Place Bet:</strong> Outcome calculated via cryptographic algorithm.</li>
          <li><strong>Verify After Bet:</strong> Server seed is revealed.</li>
          <li><strong>Confirm Outcome:</strong> Hash matches the pre-game server hash.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-4">
          <strong>Example:</strong> Dice roll: server seed hash 3f5c…; after roll, seed abc123…; client seed + nonce verify the dice outcome matches PF algorithm.
